This is a project that contains a demo website for RUET medical center. It contains several types of access Like user, admin , doctors.
To have a look at the project following steps are required.

1.Install Xampp
2.Put all the files under folder "RUET Medical Center Website" into the "htdocs" folder of Xampp.
3.Browse- localhost/rmcenter_admin_database_insert.php on your browser
4.Browse- localhost/rmc.php on your browser

For better understaning you need to get the admin login which can be accessed by creating admin account that reqires little database work.
However you can insert some pincodes in the pincode table of database and put "chief" attribute of pincode table to "yes". You can use that
pincode to create an account on the website which will fascilate some main functionalities to explore the project.

As the work is uploaded at github after a long period of creation,there can be some errors, that may occur due to
update of Xampp or other tools. Error can also occur due to inappropriate insert of data on the data tables.
